        <p>The Vulnerability Assessment course is designed for penetration testers
          and cybersecurity practitioners looking to enhance their ability to identify
          and evaluate security weaknesses in networks, applications, and systems.
          This course provides a comprehensive introduction to vulnerability assessment,
          distinguishing it from vulnerability scanning and penetration testing,
          while emphasizing its crucial role in the overall security lifecycle. Through
          hands-on labs using industry-standard tools like Nessus, and Nmap, you
          will learn to conduct thorough assessments, interpret findings, and prioritize
          vulnerabilities for remediation, equipping you with the skills needed to
          safeguard digital assets effectively.</p>
